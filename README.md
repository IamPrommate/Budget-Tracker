# Budget-Tracker

**Budget-Tracker** is a personal web application designed to help you manage and track your monthly budgets per category. I built it independently to make financial tracking simpler and to gain better insights into spending habits.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple budget categories (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment).
- Track monthly spending and adjust budgets as needed.
- Visualize spending trends and budget progress with interactive charts.
- Clean and user-friendly interface for quick budget updates.
